# RemoteDesktopConnection

This is a project based on Java which allows to control a desktop remotely

It has two modules- Client and Server.
<br>
Run the server code on the system you want to control remotely and the client code on the system you are working on.
Run the server side code first, which prompts you to set the password after which it awaits the client to connect to it.
Now run the client side code and enter the IP Address of the server and the password set by you in the next two windows that appear.
If the IP address and the password entered are correct you will be able to monitor and control the server screen from your system.
